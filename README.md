# Instakill

## Disclaimer

Instakill was was written in 2013, before the completion of the JC2MP documentation. It targets the first release of the JC2MP mod, so the mod may have partial to no current functionality.

## What it does

Instakill allows you to select a vehicle by pointing at it, and instantly blow it to smithereens. Even better, switch to range mode to destroy all vehicles in a forcefield-esque sphere around you. Races will never be the same again, since Instakill is smart enough not to destroy the vehicle you're currently driving! Lock on mode allows you to target a vehicle, and then detonate it later at your leisure.

## Usage
The 'N' key targets a vehicle for lock-on, and automatically switches the mode to lock-on if it is not already selected. The 'M' key detonates the selected vehicle(s) in all modes.

    /ik mode [mode]
Displays the currently selected mode if no operator given. Mode 0 is range, Mode 1 is targeted, and Mode 2 is lock-on.

    /ik help 
Brings up the help dialogue.
